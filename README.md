### About Buri

[Buri](https://github.com/viafoura/buri) is a toolkit geared specifically towards working with the [components that Netflix has made open-source](http://netflix.github.io) for bonkers-scale computing. They have made huge portions of their infrastructure components available on GitHub, and others have made available integrations from both an application focus, such as [Flux Capacitor](http://fluxcapacitor.com/), or from a deployment focus, such as [netflixoss-ansible](http://answersforaws.com/code/netflixoss/).

If you're new to these Netflix components, please checkout [this set of introduction slides](http://jhohertz.github.io/netflixoss-slides/), and the ones it links to.

Buri works to address the various challenges of bootstrapping the stack into the cloud, and setting up a local all-in-one development stack.

The all-in-one deploys a complete complement of the various components that Flux Capacitor uses, that can run outside of the cloud. Besides setting up sudo and an ssh key before running Buri, in one command, you get an operational and integrated:

- Flux Capacitor edge and middle tier services.
- [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) running without [Priam](https://github.com/Netflix/Priam), as it needs a cloud ASG
- [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka), with the edge and middle tier registering and discovering though it
- [Exhibitor](https://github.com/Netflix/exhibitor), with the attachment Flux Capacitor provides for [Archaius](https://github.com/Netflix/archaius) [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) support
- [Turbine](https://github.com/Netflix/turbine), aggregating runtime metrics from the middle / edge instances
- [Hystrix Dashboard](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-dashboard), for visualizing real time system performance information.
- [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/), for longer term data collection, provided by Servo, providing hundreds of data points even for the simple demonstration application Flux Capacitor provides.

There are also modes to generate cloud-ready images for EC2 enabling the cloud features of the NetflixOSS components.  See the <a href="../../wiki/Getting-started">getting started guide</a> for information on getting started using Buri in that manner. It should be posssible to use Buri in more traditional [Ansible](http://ansible.com) setups as well.
 
See the <a href="../../wiki/Buri-overview">Buri overview</a> page on the <a href="../../wiki">wiki</a> for general info.

### Quick start, Flux-in-a-Box

To setup the above configuration:

1. Setup an Ubuntu 14.04 server VM with a 'dev' user that can sudo with a NOPASSWD rule, and an ssh key. (IE: Ansible friendly). You're going to want the VM in bridged mode, or be you'll be setting up a lot of port forwards to use it. You should give it at least 3GB RAM.

2. Clone Buri from GitHub on your host:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/viafoura/buri.git
   ```

3. Make sure you have ansible installed, and from the checkout, run:

   ```
   ./all-in-one-vm.sh <IP-of-your-VM>
   ```

4. Go for a coffee. If all goes well, in 5-10 minutes, ansible should be done. It may take up to 5 minutes more, or on reboots of the VM, for everything to fully come up.

### Testing/Using the Flux-in-a-Box

1. First check on Eureka with this URL, you should see an EDGE, EUREKA, and MIDDLETIER instance registered when fully booted. Don't worry about the eureka URL never moving from unavailable-replicas to available-replicas. There are no replicas in this configuration. It will block the requests coming in until it goes through an internal cluster discovery sequence, then decide to initialize a new one. That's what takes the most time for initializing on boot.

   ```
   http://<IP-of-your-VM>:8400/eureka/jsp/status.jsp
   ```

2. Have a look at Exhibitor/Zookeeper status here. When the status is green/serving, and the server id is a positive integer, zookeeper is fully running. A negative number means it's still initializing. Node editing is enabled in the all-in-one for dev tinkering.

   ```
   http://<IP-of-your-VM>:8401
   ```

3. Pull up the Hystrix dashboard and use the turbine URL following for the stream on it's page. Keep it visible as you run edge tests.

   ```
   http://<IP-of-your-VM>:8403/hystrix-dashboard
   http://<IP-of-your-VM>:8402/turbine/turbine.stream?cluster=fluxdemo-edge
   ```

4. Generate some edge requests, run a few of the first and then the second URL. You should see graphs in real time generated on the hystrix dashboard page with very little latentcy.

   ```
   # Stuff a message onto the numbered log
   curl -D- http://<IP-of-your-VM>:8299/service/edge/v1/log/1234?log=blahblah
   # Get tge messages logged against the numbered log
   curl -D- http://<IP-of-your-VM>:8299/service/edge/v1/logs/1234
   ```

5. Have a look at the graphite console, you should see on opening the Graphite folder, trees of metrics for both the flux-edge, and flux-middletier coming from Servo. These also come in very close to real-time:

   ```
   http://<IP-of-your-VM>
   ```

6. Poke around the Karyon consoles, Eureka tab should match with step #1, and looking @ the Archaius tab is educational on what that provides:

   ```
     Edge: http://<IP-of-your-VM>:9299
   Middle: http://<IP-of-your-VM>:9399
   ```

### Status

Buri is around a late alpha kind of state. Things are starting to not move around as much, we have most of the mechanisms we need, and a fairly complete set of role templates for provisioning a good base of the NetflixOSS component stack, both to a VM and EC2. The core is not expected to change much unless needed from this point, and we should mostly be focusing on component integration and implementations as roles.
