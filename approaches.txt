Possible approaches discussed at high level here.

1) Work from tarball of an assembled system

	- we have to setup a boot/partition environment for HVM
	- could do custom partitioning, but hampers ability to share images.
		- with hd00 pvgrub, should be fine?

2) Work from an "hd0" image

	- we have to setup a boot environment, PV vs not, etc.
	- could do custom partitioning, but hampers ability to share images.
        - if used directly, would be "odd" to the HVM setup perhaps? VBR vs MBR?
	- should allow expanding the primay volume to consume all of the image space

3) Work from an "hd00" image

	- has partitioning, and a boot environment described
	- should be PV bootable with pvgrub-hd00
	- could use custom partitioning, as long as /boot is on first
	- should be easier to be universal (distro agnostic)
	- closely translates to common VM disk cases (encapsulate a whole device w/ partitions)
	- !!! need to use grub-legacy, ubuntu 1204 seems to have both grub2 and legacy, but doesn't include tooling installing it looks.
	- should allow expanding the primay volume to consume all of the image space
		- maybe better as a firstboot process?
	- if we assume one partition, mounted as /dev/sda1
		- for PV, extract partition image from disk image
