For the foundation install: NOW

- init build host
- prep volume
  - EBS attachment/mount
  - install phase
  - chroot prep
- execute foundation "role" on chroot (apply-chroot-changes.yml)
- finalize volume
  - chroot teardown
  - file cleanups
  - EBS unmount/detachment
  - EBS snapshot
  - tagging
  - report output


For the foundation install, and others: NEXT

- init build host (done externally)

- prep volume
  - aquire a device handle (not simple, hardcode for first go)
  - attach EBS, new or by snapshot
  - if new
    - install phase
  - EBS mount
- chroot prep (ansible lifts some need, might still need policy-rc.d)
- register to inventory chroot based "host"
- execute foundation (or other) role on chroot (old apply-chroot-changes.yml)
- be nice if we could offer a pause to inspect at this point for debug
- finalize volume
  - chroot teardown (same as prep, if we need it)
  - file cleanups
  - EBS unmount/detachment
  - EBS snapshot
  - tagging
  - Instance conversion/tagging
  - report output
