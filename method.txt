- Inputs:
	- Distro and version. (Ubuntu 12.04.4)
	- Machine target: HVM/PVM
	- Boot volume type: EBS/Instance
	- AMI size: 10GB max (?)
	- debugging options (IE: leave volume mounted, etc)

- Outputs:
	- A registered AMI containing the distro
	- the AMI/Snap ID of the volume created

- Assumptions:
	- no 32-bit support
	- we always use a partitioned format in the target, where possible
		- can pvgrub boot gpt? is it even worth bothering with here? maybe just do mbr and be happy with our 10GB root. TBD
	- pv mode will always use a pv-grub hd00 AKI, attempt to emulate HVM, re: disk layout mostly for image sharing
		- why the heck not? treat the no-partition case as legacy.
		- the compromise is, we always assume one partition, in case we need to build the legacy type (as an extraction from a built "normal" image)
	- we always work with volumes of a single partition
		- really, we could handle other cases, but to allow growing into a volume, the final partition would be the one to grow.
			- for now, i'm ignoring the case, because it adds other complexities.
		- elaborate arrangements of partitioning really don't add value to ephemeral disks. stay simple
	- Aminator can be coaxed into supporting hd00 type volumes
		- if we stick to a one-partition rule, we should fine.
		- wrap a new volume handler into the existing framework for the case, and define an environment for it. (I think?)

- Distro image source is aquired.
	- sources: local file, URL, maybe a stored EBS snapshot or bundle?
- Source is aquired/connected, and mounted
