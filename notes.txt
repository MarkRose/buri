ROOT DEVICE (AMI)

Instance store:

	- image copies to root volume (sda1 typical)
	- no persistence
        - no "stop", only terminate

EBS Store:

	- can reconfig stopped machine (volumes, kernel, etc)
	- can persist (don't by default)

BLOCK DEVICE MAPPING

	- depending on instance type, additional devices can be added
	- AMIs may specify multiple devices.
	- Instance mappings merge/overwrite the AMI mappings. Root can't be overwritten.

PV MODE

	- original xen, pure paravirtualized.
	- well supported, several tools for AMI gen
	- root is typically /dev/sda1 (?)
		- I see mention of ephemeral on /dev/sda2/3 however...
		- Partitions are a magical thing that don't really exist in PV. All attachment is at the partition level
			- IE: you will have /dev/sda1 without a /dev/sda!
	- EBS can attatch as partitions to a ghost disk
	- possible to boot custom kernel via "pv-grub" kernels

HVM MODE

	- more like vmware, full hardware virtualized.
        - PV drivers available still
	- block devices are sane, not like in PV
	- root/boot more typically /dev/sda1
		- EC2 docs say HVM bundling must spec --partition
	- EBS only attaches as whole disks
