EBS HVM
ami=/dev/sda1
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- has a and a1

EBS PVM
ami=/dev/sda1
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- no a, just a1, and an a3 (a3 probably swap)

S3 PVM
ami=sda1
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- no a, just a1

S3 HVM
ami=sda1
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- a, a1, a14, 15 (probably GPT)


-----------

My Flat HVM EBS
ami=/dev/sda1
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- only an a, no a1 (wrong, but flat HVM is odd)

My Flat PVM S3
ami=/dev/sda1
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- no a, just a1, and an a3 (a3 probably swap)

My Flat S3 HVM
ami=sda
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- only an a, no a1 (wrong, but flat HVM is odd)

My Flat S3 PVM
ami=sda			(this seems odd, should be sda1 we'd think)
root=/dev/sda1
ephemeral
- only an a, no a1 (wrong, should be only a1, no a, the ami=sda may be what is doing this)
