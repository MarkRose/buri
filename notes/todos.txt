- make a foundation-create-volume that
	- works with the "disk1" image
	- registers both HVM and PVM EBS AMIs
	- later:
	- creates an instance bundle
	- registers both HVM and PVM Instance AMIs

- test all cases of above.

- EC2 docs describe Instance->EBS transfer, which is nice, however
	- it would be a lot more convenient to go the other way
	- making bundles the primary target would be smelly
	- so prove a path towards instead doing EBS->Instance
		- could be a post-process against snapshot or
		- done before volume disconnected
