# This needs to list all top-level roles that would be aminated, resnaped, or applied.
# Every role gets a group, however not all need have group vars specified. Most native
# Buri operations inject a host dynamically, which will be where it ties a run to a host.
# Specific configurations come as child groups that "subclass" by inheriting and overriding
# the parent. A "normal" ansible setup would actually specifiy some hosts
# Eventually we will allow looking to inventory in local/ which may help such goals

# NOTE: List is what's been setup for running in the cloud, which is assumed for all but development environments by default
